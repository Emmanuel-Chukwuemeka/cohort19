					CSS	was	grown	out	of	the	necessity	of	styling	web	pages.	Before	CSS	was	introduced,	people wanted	a	way	to	style	their	web	pages,	which	looked	all	very	similar	and	"academic"	back	in the	day.	You	couldn't	do	much	in	terms	of	personalisation.
			HTML	3.2	introduced	the	option	of	defining	colors	inline	as	HTML	element	attributes,	and presentational	tags	like		center		and		font	,	but	that	escalated	quickly	into	a	far	from	ideal situation.
			CSS	let	us	move	everything	presentation-related	from	the	HTML	to	the	CSS,	so	that	HTML could	get	back	being	the	format	that	defines	the	structure	of	the	document,	rather	than	how things	should	look	in	the	browser.
			CSS	is	continuously	evolving,	and	CSS	you	used	5	years	ago	might	just	be	outdated,	as	new idiomatic	CSS	techniques	emerged	and	browsers	changed.
			It's	hard	to	imagine	the	times	when	CSS	was	born	and	how	different	the	web	was.
			At	the	time,	we	had	several	competing	browsers,	the	main	ones	being	Internet	Explorer	or Netscape	Navigator.
			Pages	were	styled	by	using	HTML,	with	special	presentational	tags	like		bold		and	special attributes,	most	of	which	are	now	deprecated.
